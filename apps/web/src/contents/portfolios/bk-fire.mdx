## 📍 Abstract  

The Fire Detection and Response System is designed to monitor and respond to fire incidents in real-time. The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for fire classification and a robotic system equipped with sensors and actuators to detect and act upon fire events. The CNN model is trained to classify images into two categories: "fire" and "no fire." The robotic system is capable of responding to fire detection by activating various components, such as a water pump, buzzer, and robotic arm, to mitigate potential fire hazards.

## 🌟 Features  

- **Real-Time Fire Detection**: Detects and classifies fire from live video feeds.  
- **CNN Model for Image Classification**: Uses a deep learning model for accurate fire detection.  
- **Robotic Response System**: A robotic arm with sensors and actuators responds to detected fire events.  
- **SMS Notification**: Sends SMS alerts to users when fire is detected.  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the detection thresholds for optimal performance.  
- **Ease of Use**: Run the Python scripts for both fire detection and robotic response with minimal setup.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

Before you can run this project, ensure the following packages are installed:

- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- OpenCV  
- Twilio  
- Geocoder  
- Raspberry Pi GPIO  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/verus56/bk-fire.git  
cd fire-detection-system  
```  

2. Install required dependencies:  

```bash  
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python twilio geocoder  
```  

3. Set up your Raspberry Pi with the necessary sensors (flame, smoke, etc.) and actuators (water pump, buzzer, LED, servo motor).  

### Running the App  

To test the model with the webcam:  

```bash  
python firewithtsms.py  
```  

To detect fire and send SMS alerts:  

```bash  
python fire-with-all.py  
```  

To run the robotic system:  

```bash  
python robot.py  
```  

## 🤖 How It Works  

1. **Fire Detection**: The CNN model analyzes the video stream or images to detect fire and classify them.  
2. **Robotic System**: Once fire is detected, the robotic system is activated to respond using sensors, a water pump, buzzer, and a servo-controlled robotic arm.  
3. **SMS Alerts**: Twilio is used to send SMS notifications to the designated users when fire is detected.  

## 📊 Technical Stack  

- **AI Engine**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV  
- **Data Processing**: NumPy  
- **Robotic System**: Raspberry Pi GPIO, Servo Motor, Water Pump  
- **Cloud API**: Twilio (SMS Alerts)  
- **Geocoding**: Geocoder  

## 🛠️ Deployment  

This system can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi or other compatible hardware for real-time fire detection and response.
