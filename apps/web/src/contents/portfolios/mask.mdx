## 📍 Abstract

The Face Detection and Recognition with Mask Detection system is designed for real-time facial recognition using the MTCNN and Facenet models. The system can detect faces and recognize individuals while also identifying whether they are wearing a mask. The project integrates the EfficientNetB3 model for mask detection and uses a live webcam feed for real-time processing. It can be used for applications such as identifying vaccinated persons in environments where mask-wearing is mandatory.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition**: Detect and recognize faces in real-time using live webcam feeds.
- **Mask Detection**: Uses the EfficientNetB3 model to detect whether a person is wearing a mask.
- **MTCNN for Face Detection**: Detect faces with high accuracy using the MTCNN model.
- **Vaccinated Person Identification**: The system identifies vaccinated individuals through mask detection.
- **Live Webcam Integration**: Processes live webcam video streams for real-time monitoring.
- **Easy Setup**: Run the Python scripts for face detection, recognition, and mask detection with minimal setup.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, ensure the following packages are installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- MTCNN
- EfficientNetB3
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verus56/d-tection-et-de-reconnaissance-facial-avec-masque-bas-e-sur-mtcnn-facnet
cd face-detection-system
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python mtcnn efficientnet numpy scikit-learn
```

### Running the App

To train the model with your images:

```bash
python train_v2.py
```

To detect faces in real-time:

```bash
python detect.py
```

To detect face masks:

```bash
python detectmask.py
```

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: The MTCNN model detects faces from the webcam feed.
2. **Face Recognition**: Facenet is used to recognize the detected faces.
3. **Mask Detection**: EfficientNetB3 checks whether the person is wearing a mask.
4. **Vaccinated Identification**: Based on mask detection, the system identifies whether a person is vaccinated.

## 📊 Technical Stack

- **AI Engine**: MTCNN, Facenet, EfficientNetB3
