## 📍 Abstract  

This Face Recognition System uses MTCNN for detecting faces in images and Facenet for encoding the detected faces into unique vectors that can be compared to others for identification and verification. The system can be extended for more complex applications, including security systems and personalized experiences.

## 🌟 Features  

- **Face Detection**: MTCNN is used for detecting faces in images.  
- **Face Encoding**: Facenet encodes faces into unique vectors for recognition.  
- **Face Comparison**: The system compares the encoded vectors to identify the closest match.  
- **Real-time Recognition**: The system can process images in real-time for face identification.  
- **Database Integration**: Add images of people to the face recognition database for comparison.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

Before you can run this project, ensure the following packages are installed:

- TensorFlow  
- MTCNN  
- Keras  
- OpenCV  
- scikit-learn  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/verus56/face-recognition-based-sur-mtcnn-facenet.git  
cd face-recognition-based-sur-mtcnn-facenet  
```  

2. Install the required dependencies:  

```bash  
pip install tensorflow mtcnn keras opencv-python scikit-learn  
```  

### Running the App  

Run the main file to start the face recognition application:

```bash  
python main.py  
```  

The application will start, and you can begin adding images to the face recognition database and use them for recognition.

## 🤖 How It Works  

1. **Face Detection**: MTCNN detects faces in images added to the database.  
2. **Face Encoding**: Facenet encodes the detected faces into unique vectors.  
3. **Recognition**: When a new image is submitted, it is processed in the same way, and the resulting vector is compared with stored vectors in the database.  
4. **Match Identification**: The system identifies the closest match based on vector comparison.

## 📊 Technical Stack  

- **AI Engine**: MTCNN (for face detection), Facenet (for face encoding)  
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV  
- **Data Processing**: scikit-learn  
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras  

## 🛠️ Deployment  

This system can be run locally for individual face recognition or extended for integration into larger security systems.
