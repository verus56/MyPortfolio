## 📍 Abstract

The Sokoban Solver is an AI-based solution to solving the Sokoban puzzle using the A* and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The goal of the puzzle is to move boxes to target positions within a maze while avoiding obstacles. This solver efficiently finds the optimal path for solving the puzzle by leveraging search algorithms to explore all possible moves and find the shortest solution.

## 🌟 Features

- **Sokoban Puzzle Solver**: Solves Sokoban puzzles using AI search algorithms.
- **A* and BFS Algorithms**: Uses A* and BFS for optimal and breadth-first search approaches.
- **Deadlock Detection**: Detects deadlocks to avoid unsolvable scenarios.
- **Easy Setup**: Run the Python script to solve Sokoban puzzles with minimal configuration.
- **Visual Representation**: Provides a visual representation of the puzzle solving process.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, ensure the following packages are installed:

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verus56/sokoban-solver
cd sokoban-solver
```

2. Install required dependencies (if necessary):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the App

To solve a Sokoban puzzle:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Puzzle Initialization**: The puzzle grid is initialized with positions of walls, targets, boxes, and the player.
2. **A* Algorithm**: A* search is used to find the shortest path to move the boxes into target positions, considering obstacles.
3. **BFS Algorithm**: BFS explores all possible moves systematically to find the solution, useful in scenarios where A* is not ideal.
4. **Deadlock Detection**: The system identifies deadlocks to avoid futile exploration of unsolvable puzzles.

## 📊 Technical Stack

- **AI Engine**: A* and BFS Algorithms
- **Puzzle Solving**: Sokoban Puzzle Logic
- **Search Algorithms**: A*, BFS
- **Language**: Python

## 🛠️ Deployment

This system can be run locally on any machine with Python installed to solve Sokoban puzzles of various complexity levels.
